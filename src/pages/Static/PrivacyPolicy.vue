  <span class="heading">INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</span>
  <p class="text">
    Certain areas and features of Ofirio.com are available to you without registration or the need to provide to us any information. However, other features of the Site or the Service may require registration, which involves provision to Ofirio of an email address, a password and additional details for fulfilling your service requests and to participate on our third party sites, a username (collectively the “Registration or Sign Up Information”). In order to benefit from the full functionality of the Service, you may also be asked to provide additional information to all Ofirio to share more data for your use.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    From time to time we may request other personal information to provide you with other benefits of the Service such as application for a loan or payment instructions for purchasing a property. In all such instances, you will be given the opportunity to provide or to decline to provide that information, and it will be used only for the stated purpose. By providing the information, you are also agreeing to share the information with other Service providers such as Property Provider, lender, insurance company, Title company, Escrow/ Closing Attorney, inspection company, appraisal company and others for fulfilling your buy/ sell/ manage service requests. We may collect credit or debit card information in order to process payments but all payment processing will be handled by a third party payment processor.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Ofirio may make anonymous or aggregate personal information and disclose such data only in a non-personally identifiable manner to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes, such as the number of users who applied for a loan or how many users clicked on a particular Offer from Ofirio;
    </li>
    <li>
      Organizations approved by Ofirio that conduct research into investment purchases; and
    </li>
    <li>
      Users of the Service for purposes of comparison of their personal financial situation relative to the broader market.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text">
    Such information does not identify you individually. Access to your Registration Information, other Credentials, and any other personal information you provide is strictly restricted and used in accordance with specific internal procedures and safeguard governing access, in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. These individuals have been selected in accordance with our security policies and practices and are bound by confidentiality obligations. We may also use third party vendors or service providers to help us provide the Service to you, such as sending e-mail messages on our behalf or hosting and operating a particular feature or functionality of the Service or a lender processing your loan application. Our contracts with these third parties outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit them from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service they are providing. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.
